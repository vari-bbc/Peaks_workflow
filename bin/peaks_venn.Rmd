# ChipSeeker venn produces different counts than Homer mergePeaks, ChipPeakAnno makeVennDiagram and my own manual checks with R findOverlaps (those were consistent with each other). ChipSeeker appears to be using a different definition of overlap than the defaults in the above methods. Unfortunately, ChipSeeker documentation is unclear as to how it determines overlaps and does not seem to use typical GenomicRanges findOverlaps etc fucntions like ChipPeakAnno does.
